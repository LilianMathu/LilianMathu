### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I am a full-stack MERN developer with good knowledge of front-end techniques. I love structure and order and I also stand for quality. I love spending time on fixing little details and optimizing web apps. Also, I like working in a team, you'll learn faster and much more. As the saying goes: 'two heads are better than one'. I am a design-thinking enthusiast, with great interest in creating human-centered apps.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my startup Mobile Mechanics
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning design-thinking and advanced React
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on design-thinking apps
